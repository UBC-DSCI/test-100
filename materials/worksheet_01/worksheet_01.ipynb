The lecture worksheets will automatically be collected at the start of the weekly tutorial. Conversely, the tutorial assigments will automatically be collected at the start of the weekly lecture. This is set up so that you are only working on one thing at a time. Attendance in lectures and tutorials are required. There will be participatory activities in both the lecture and tutorial to help support your learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on lecture worksheets and tutorial assignments is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in lecture or tutorial, so ask a neighbor, TA or an instructor for help (explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it). Please don't just share answers, though. Everyone must submit a copy of their own work.\n",

    "* create new code and markdown cells in a Jupyter notebook\n",

    "* create new variables and objects in R using the assignment symbol\n",
    "* use the help and documentation tools in R\n",
    "* match the names of the following functions from the `tidyverse` library to their documentation descriptions: \n",
    "    - `read_csv` \n",
    "    - `select`\n",
    "    - `mutate`\n",
    "    - `filter`\n",
    "    - `ggplot`\n",
    "    - `aes`\n",
    "* chain together two functions using the pipe operator, `%>%`\n",

    "### Data about runners!\n",
    "Researchers, Vickers and Vertosick performed [a study in 2016](https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-016-0052-y) that aimed to identify what factors affect race performance of recreational runners so that they could build better models to predict 5 km, 10 km and marathon race times. Such models can help runners by suggesting changes they could make to modifiable factors, such as training, to help them improve race time. Unmodifiable factors in the model, such as age or sex, allow for fair comparisons to be made between different runners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vickers and Vertosick reasoned that their study is important because all previous research done to predict races times has focused on data from elite athletes. This biased data set means that the models generated from them do not necessarily do a good job predicting race times for recreational runners (whose data was not in the dataset that created the models). Additionally, previous research focused on reporting/measuring factors that require special expertise or equipment that are not freely available to recreational runners. This means that recreational runners may not be able to put their characteristics/measurements for these factors in the race time prediction models and so they will not be able to obtain an accurate prediction, or a prediction at all (in the case of some models).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a better model, Vickers and Vertosick performed a large survey. They put their survey on the news website [Slate.com](https://slate.com/) attached to a news story about race time prediction. They were able to obtain 2,497 responses. The survey included questions that allowed them to collect a data set that included: \n",
    "- age,\n",
    "- sex,\n",
    "- body mass index (BMI),\n",
    "- whether they are an edurance runner or speed demon,\n",
    "- what type of shoes they wear,\n",
    "- what type of training they do,\n",
    "- race time for 2-3 races they completed in the last 6 months,\n",
    "- self-rated fitness for each race,\n",
    "- and race difficulty for each race.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now use this data to explore a question we might be interested in - is there a relationship between 5 km race time and body mass index (BMI) for women runners (if there is, then it might be a useful factor to include in a race time prediction model for these runners). We will answer this question by visualizing the data as a scatter plot using R. To accomplish this, we will need to do the following things in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. load the data set into R\n",
    "2. subset the data we are interested in visualizing from the loaded dataset\n",
    "3. create a new column to get the unit of time in minutes instead of seconds\n",
    "4. create a scatter plot using this modified data"
